Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website

File list
Video.py
video_config.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
 
This static web page displays a list of my favourite  "5 star movies" with their corresponding
youtube trailers,box art imagery and descriptions. This project uses Python and HTML to aid in
developing server-side code to store a list of movies within Python objects.


How to Run: 
To run the script, clone this repository directory and run video_config.py. 
If executed successfully, a new html page movie_trailer will be generated or overwritten. 
You can view the page by opening movie_trailer.html with any web browser.
