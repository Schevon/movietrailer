II.How To Run "movie trailer website":
---------------
Navigate into VideoTrailerProject folder
Using a Python IDE such as IDLE,open and run video_config.py
After compilation a movie_trailer.html file will be generated within that very same folder. 
Use any browser (preferably Chrome) to open and run  movie_trailer.html.
Click on any of the box art images to play their corresponding trailer.

III. Design and Implementation
--------------
 Movie descriptions,images and trailers are  courtesy of imdb.com,wikipedia.com,google.com and youtube.com  
 
 video.py  creates a movie class and initializes its constructor. For good OOP practice
 another .py file (video_config.py) contains instances of the movie object in which variables are passed into the movie constructor.
 These values passed into the various movie objects are previously stored in variables of type String just for code readability purposes.
 These movie objects are then stored in an array and then passed into a method of fresh_tomatoes.py called openUrl().
 fresh_tomatoes.py  code was given by Udacity staff and was modified  to meet the necessary specifications.

IV.General Installation Notes
--------------
No installation notes required.
